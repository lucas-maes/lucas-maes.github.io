### Research Live Streaming

I will try to occasionally share my research process through live streaming on twitch. I think it is a good way to first, keep track of my progress and second, propose a transparent and open way of doing research. I will also try to explain the concepts I am working on and answer questions from the chat. *Disclaimer: I am mainly doing this for myself*
