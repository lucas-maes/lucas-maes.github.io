## About me

Iâ€™m a Belgian second-year research M.Sc student in artificial intelligence at the <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/" target="_blank">University of Montreal</a> under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xsUkTCEAAAAJ&hl=fr">Houari Sahraoui</a>, currently working on applying regularized non-contrastive method for learning code embeddings.

One could consider my life goal as *"Understanding the real through building an abstraction that captures its essence"*. In my opinion, achieving that goal must be through math and physics. Driven by that idea, I'm self-studying pure math and physics in my free time. Building a theory of intelligence is a crucial part of that journey as humans make, understand, and interpret reality through their brains. For that, I like thinking about what artificial neural networks, as well as how they work, are telling us using mathematical frameworks.

I am deeply convinced that a good scientist is open-minded and curious. That is why I don't restrict myself to any particular research domain and keep learning every day (mostly related to cs, math and physics). After my master, I would like to evolve theories, study them, and maybe, extract elegant closed-form expressions from them.

Some mathematical domains that I like are constrained optimization, optimal transport theory, information theory, measure theory, game theory and differentiable geometry.

Check out [Readings](/readings) and [CV](/cv) sections to learn more about me.

### Research directions

In this section, I will try the give a brief overview of the subject that catches my interest and what I am currently working on. Note that, as mentioned before, I am mostly driven by curiosity meaning that the below list is non-exhaustive. However, I tried to focus on the most important domains that I would like to work on over the coming years.

#### Deep learning theory
My main interest in deep learning theory is the self-supervised learning theory, i.e studying both how representation collapse occurs and how to prevent it. This includes the discovery of new regularizing methods and their effect on learning landscape, e.g. <a href="https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/en/week08/08-2/"> Regularized Latent Variable Energy Based model</a>. I very much appreciate the work of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S1x_xqcAAAAJ&hl=en"> Randall Balestriero</a>.

But I also read about these research areas :

* Studying how to build efficient optimizers such as Adam, Nesterov momentum, RMSProp, .... But also proving their convergence and effects on neural network training.
* Formally understanding why neural networks are working, what is a good representation, what is generalization and use those mathematical principles to build a theory of intelligence as proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.04630.pdf">On the Principles of Parsimony and Self-Consistency
for the Emergence of Intelligence</a> from Ma & al., 2022 
* Studying how to make efficient generative latent variable models (e.g. manifold learning, VAE, GANs). Especially through optimal transport theory as in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07875.pdf"> Wasserstein GAN</a>.

A good ressource to learn more about these concepts is <a href="http://mitliagkas.github.io/ift6085-dl-theory-class/">Ioannis Mitliagkas's DL theory</a> course.


#### Pure and/or Computational mathematics
The idea of contributing directly to pure and/or computational mathematics is an idea that also highly interests me.
I am an actively reader of <a href="https://twitter.com/gabrielpeyre"> Grabriel Peyre's tweet</a> about computational mathematics.

Here are some of the domains that I like to learn about in which I would like to contribute in the future (using pure math, computational methods or AI):

* Constrained optimization
* Physics / Mathematical physics (problem to be defined)
* Optimal transport theory
* Information theory
* Measure theory
* Game theory
* Differential geometry

*** 
I want to give a **special mention** to a paper I read recently and which is for me one of the best I have ever read namely <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12301.pdf" target="_blank"> On the Limitations of Elo: Real-World Games, are Transitive, not Additive</a> by Bertrand & al., 2022. Besides being extremely relevant and well-written, this is exactly the kind of article I would like to write. That is an article that can help both the field of pure mathematics and the field of AI. You can find my notes on this paper <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### Current direction
Before diving into more theoretical research for Ph.D., I had in mind to get an overview of what applied research could look like. I tough that it could benefit me by improving my coding skills and be helpful to the lab by bringing knowledge acquired through courses that I took. Therefore I choose to see how software engineering could benefit from deep learning. It gives me insights into how abording practical problems but also strongly reinforces my coding skills. 
My master thesis consists of applying regularized non-contrastive method for learning code embeddings, i.e I use VICReg to learn code embeddings.
