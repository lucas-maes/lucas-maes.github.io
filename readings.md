A lot of my acquired knowledge is coming from self-study and personal readings. On that page, I will maintain and try to give an overview of the book that had been helpful to me. You can have a look to the books that I'm planning to read over the coming months <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/wishlists/WLDQM4" target="_blank"> here</a>. I also learn a lot through paper reading. I’m trying to practice reviewing them. For an up-to-date list of papers that I read, please check my <a href="https://github.com/lucas-maes/paper-notes" target="_blank">papers-notes</a> github repository.

        <br>
        <span class="author"> by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville</span>
    </p>
I read that book the year before taking the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ift6135-h2022/course-description">course</a> taught by Aaron Courville. I am deeply convinced that it helped me pass with a good grade. Although a bit old, this book remains a good reference for learning basic deep-learning concepts.

        <a href="https://amzn.to/3fMnTf5" target="_blank">Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction</a>
        <br>
        <span class="author"> by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto</span>
    </p>
This book is one of the best reinforcement learning references, especially the second version released in 2018. I read it before taking the <a href="https://fracturedplane.notion.site/fracturedplane/Robot-Learning-Course-IFT6163-abff93e62e514bcdb9173d09bc668812">robot learning</a> course at MILA and was a game changer. I had never done RL previously in my life. However, the concepts are well explained and the authors start from the beginning to the most recent methods. That book contains many examples and plots to illustrate presented concepts and exercises to practice the knowledge that you will acquire from the book.

    <p class="title">
        <a href="https://amzn.to/3ykvwzE" target="_blank">Mathematics for machine learning</a>
        <br>
        <span class="author"> by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong</span>
    </p>
    I strongly recommend that book to any student or curious person that would like to work with/understand machine learning. It is a good refresher for concepts from vector calculus, linear algebra, probability, and statistics. The book has good motivations. Furthermore, care has been taken to give concrete examples on how subject learned could be applied in machine learning.

        <br>
        <span class="author"> by Yann Le Cun</span>
    </p>
This book has been important to me. It has been the first book about AI that I read. I like the way Yann Le Cun described how he went into AI research, the years at Bell Labs, and the way he created FAIR. He vulgarized with simple words how machines can learn and how he contributed to the field as with CNN. I also appreciate the last book part in which Yann breaks down common ideas about the machine and the future of AI research.

        <br>
        <span class="author"> by Aurélien Géron</span>
    </p>
    I read that book during my undergrad studies, just after Yann Le Cun's book. I recommend it as the autor pedagogically introduced every machine learning concept using well-crafted explanations, plots, and Sci-kit learn code. For the deep learning part, I would recommend it but try to implement code using <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a>. It is a more user-friendly and more interesting deep learning python framework.

    <p class="title">
        <a href="https://amzn.to/3rQXGPr" target="_blank">Théorème vivant</a>
        <br>
        <span class="author"> by Cédric Villani</span>
    </p>
    This book was an eye-opener for me. It showed me how beautiful, social, and profound mathematic research could be. The book depicts how the field medal laureate Crédic Villani managed to prove the theorem that made him win the medal.After the reading, it convinced me that my future research directions intensively use pure mathematics. Cédric Villani has greatly influenced me. He transmitted his passion for mathematics to me and was an open-eyer about the beauty of the mathematician profession. Therefore, I strongly recommend his book to everyone, especially those who are not in academia.

        <br>
        <span class="author"> by Stephen Abbott</span>
    </p>
    An educational masterpiece for learning real analysis. That book was the first step on my self-study math journey. It comes with many exercises to make the reader deeply think about presented results and allow him to build his intuition about the concepts. It was an helpful resource in learning how to construct proofs and play with real analysis concepts.

    <p class="title">
        <a href="https://amzn.to/3Vv1J1b" target="_blank">DO NOT ERASE, Mathematicians and their chalkboards</a>
        <br>
        <span class="author"> by Jessica Wynne</span>
    </p>
    DO NOT ERASE is proof that mathematics is an art. The book is a collection of well-shooted pictures from mathematicians' chalkboards. Additionally to each chalkboard, a little text written by the board's owner describes what he is working on and how he tackles problems. It is a piece of art and an inspiring book.

        <br>
        <span class="author"> by Etienne Klein</span>
    </p>
    The book is a journey through the life of Albert Einstein. Étienne Klein is cycling through all the important places where Albert Einstein had been staying in Switzerland, while making some philosophical links between his journey and the scientific contributions made by Einstein. A good summer reading that I enjoyed a lot.

    <p class="title">
        <a href="https://amzn.to/3Maf7DV" target="_blank" >Livewired</a>
        <br>
        <span class="author"> by David Eagleman</span>
    </p>
    In his book, David Eagleman convinced me that the brain is a dynamic, ever-changing machine made for learning. In a well-written style, he showed how our brain can acquire new senses and adapt to new situations thanks to high neuroplasticity. One could see many potential research ideas for continual learning in AI to solve well-known problems such as catastrophic forgetting or generalization out of distribution.

    <p class="title">
        <a href="https://juliadatascience.io/" target="_blank" >Julia Data Science</a>
        <br>
        <span class="author"> by Jose Storopoli, Rik Huijzer, Lazaro Alonso</span>
    </p>
    This book is one of the best references for learning the Julia programming language. It focuses especially on doing efficient data science thanks to the power provided by language conception. I like Julia as it is a good solution for the <a href="https://juliadatascience.io/julia_accomplish">Two language problem</a> and has many scientific programming libraries build-in. In my opinion, Julia is the future of scientific Programmation. Especially for differentiable programming as Julia can build efficient auto-diff program using framework such as <a href="https://fluxml.ai/Zygote.jl/latest/"> Zygote</a>. Furthermore, the book is free 😉.
